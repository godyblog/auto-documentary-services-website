# OTO Documentary & Office Services Website

This project is a simple, responsive website built for **OTO Documentary & Office Services**, a local office and printing business based in Agyati Bafut, Bamenda, Cameroon.

The website clearly presents the business services and contact information so customers can easily understand what the business does and how to reach them online.

## Purpose of the Project

This website was built primarily as a **practical learning project**.

I created it to apply and test my frontend web development skills using a real business that operates in my local area and where I am directly familiar with the day-to-day services offered.

The goal was to:

- Practice building a complete, real-world website from scratch  
- Translate an offline business into a clear online presence  
- Focus on clarity, simplicity, and mobile-first usability  
- Create something that could realistically be used by the business if approved  

At the same time, the site serves as a simple online reference point where customers can view the business services and contact details.

## Features

The website is a single-page layout designed for quick access to information.

It clearly displays:
- Business name and location  
- Services offered (printing, photocopying, typing, basic design, passport photos)  
- Operating hours  
- Direct WhatsApp contact  

The design is intentionally simple and practical, reflecting how local customers actually search for and use business information online.

## Built With

- HTML for structure  
- CSS for layout and responsiveness  
- Vanilla JavaScript for basic interactivity  

No frameworks or libraries were used.

## Lessons Learned

Building this project reinforced several important lessons:

- Clear language matters as much as clean code, especially for local businesses  
- Naming and wording can affect how websites are perceived online  
- Simple websites are often more effective than complex ones for small businesses  
- Mobile-first design is essential in environments where most users browse on phones  
- Real businesses provide better learning experience than imaginary projects  

This project helped bridge the gap between theory and practical, real-world application.

## Status

This website has been deployed for testing and learning purposes.

Final decisions regarding branding, domain name, and official use will be made after presenting the project to the business owner.
